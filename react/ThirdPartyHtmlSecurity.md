If I have used third party library that return html content and we have to show in React application, then how can we sure, it will not affect our security compliance

Ah, this is a **very important security concern** in React apps! When you’re using third-party libraries that return HTML content (like WYSIWYG editors, preview libraries, or even APIs returning HTML snippets), you need to be cautious about **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks**. Let me break it down clearly:

---

### 1. **Understand the risk**

- **XSS** happens when untrusted HTML or scripts are injected into your page, allowing attackers to run malicious JS.
- If the library returns raw HTML and you directly render it using React’s `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, it **can execute malicious scripts**.

Example (dangerous):

```jsx
function MyComponent({ htmlContent }) {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: htmlContent }} />;
}
```

If `htmlContent` comes from a malicious source, it could steal cookies, tokens, or perform actions as the user.

### 2. **Safe ways to render HTML in React**

#### Option A: **Sanitize HTML**

Use a library like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to clean the HTML before rendering:

```bash
npm install dompurify
```

```jsx
import DOMPurify from "dompurify";

function SafeComponent({ htmlContent }) {
  const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(htmlContent);
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: cleanHTML }} />;
}
```

- This removes `<script>` tags and unsafe attributes.
- You can configure it to allow safe tags if needed.

#### Option B: **Use React-specific HTML rendering**

- If the content can be converted to **JSX instead of raw HTML**, React’s JSX escaping is safe.
- Example: Convert `<b>bold</b>` into `<strong>bold</strong>` in JSX instead of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

#### Option C: **Whitelist or transform content**

- Only allow certain tags and attributes.
- If the third-party library gives **HTML + scripts**, parse it and remove scripts or event handlers.

---

### 3. **Check the library’s reputation**

- Open-source? Check issues for XSS reports.
- Maintained? Last update?
- Avoid libraries that directly insert unsafe HTML without sanitization.

---

### 4. **Security compliance steps**

- **Sanitize input** (using DOMPurify or similar).
- **Audit third-party libraries** for vulnerabilities.
- **Limit usage** of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Optionally, use a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** header to prevent inline scripts from executing.

---

✅ **Rule of thumb:** Never trust HTML from external sources. Always sanitize, and only use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with sanitized content.
