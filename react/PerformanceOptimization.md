To **optimize performance** in a large React app, I follow these key strategies:

1. **Code splitting** – I use dynamic `import()` with React.lazy and Suspense to load parts of the app only when needed.
2. **Memoization** – I use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
3. **Virtualization** – I use libraries like `react-window` for big lists to render only what's visible.
4. **Avoid unnecessary re-renders** – I track props/state properly and use keys correctly in lists.
5. **Lazy load images and components** – This reduces initial page load time.
6. **Use production build** – I always build with `npm run build` which minifies and optimizes the output.
7. **Optimize expensive operations** – I debounce API calls, throttle events like scroll or resize.
8. **Use Performance Profiler** – I use React DevTools and Chrome DevTools to spot bottlenecks.

### 🧠 **Trick to Remember – "L.A.M.P C.O.L.D"**

(LAMP = for speed, COLD = for delay/defer)

- **L** – Lazy loading

- **A** – Avoid unnecessary renders

- **M** – Memoization (React.memo, useMemo)

- **P** – Production build

- **C** – Code splitting

- **O** – Optimize big lists (virtualization)

- **L** – Limit expensive operations (debounce/throttle)

- **D** – DevTools for profiling

---

### 💡 Example:

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  // useMemo to avoid recalculating
  const formattedName = useMemo(() => {
    return name.toUpperCase();
  }, [name]);

  return <div>{formattedName}</div>;
});
```

This helps prevent re-renders unless `name` changes, saving performance in large lists or UI.

## 🔁 **1. How does `React.memo` work and when should you use it?**

### ✅ **Answer:**

`React.memo` is a **Higher-Order Component** that prevents re-rendering unless props change.
It’s useful when a component is **pure** and receives the same props most of the time.

### 🧠 Trick:

> **"Memo = Don't redo unless needed"**

---

### 💡 **Code:**

```jsx
const MyButton = React.memo(({ label, onClick }) => {
  console.log("Rendering:", label);
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
});
```

If the `label` or `onClick` doesn’t change, `MyButton` won’t re-render. Saves performance!

---

## 📦 **2. What is code splitting in React?**

### ✅ **Answer:**

Code splitting lets you **load only the part of your code that's needed**, not the entire app upfront.

I use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to split and load components only when they’re needed.

---

### 💡 **Code:**

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./HeavyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

> Only loads `HeavyComponent` when it's rendered — improves initial load speed.

---

## 🧠 **3. What is the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?**

### ✅ **Answer:**

- `useMemo` – caches a **computed value**.
- `useCallback` – caches a **function**.

Use them to avoid recalculating or recreating things on every render.

---

### 💡 **Code Example:**

```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeHeavyCalculation(data);
}, [data]);

const memoizedClickHandler = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, []);
```

---

## 🧪 **4. How do you detect performance issues in a React app?**

### ✅ **Answer:**

I use **React DevTools Profiler** and **Chrome Performance tab** to:

- Detect unnecessary renders
- Monitor slow component updates
- Track long tasks (reflows, repaints)

---

## 📚 **5. What is virtualization and how does it help?**

### ✅ **Answer:**

**Virtualization** renders **only visible items** in a long list (like a table of 1000 rows).
This reduces DOM load and improves performance.

---

### 💡 **Code Example:**

```jsx
import { FixedSizeList as List } from "react-window";

<List height={400} itemCount={1000} itemSize={35} width={300}>
  {({ index, style }) => <div style={style}>Row {index}</div>}
</List>;
```

> Renders only visible rows – not all 1000 at once.
