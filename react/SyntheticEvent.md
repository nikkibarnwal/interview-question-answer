## 📘 **What is a Synthetic Event in React?**

> **Synthetic Event** React ka ek wrapper hai around native browser events.
> Ye React ke event system ko **cross-browser compatible**, efficient, aur consistent banata hai.

🧠 Hindi + English Mix:

> Jab React koi event handle karta hai (like `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`), to wo native browser event ke upar ek **SyntheticEvent** banata hai — jise React internally handle karta hai.

---

## 💡 **Remember Trick:**

> **Synthetic = Smart Copy** of real browser event
> Socho ek duplicate ID card jo real jaisa dikhta hai, lekin company ke rules ke according bana hota hai (React controlled).

---

## ✅ Example:

```jsx
function ButtonClick() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    console.log("Synthetic Event:", event); // SyntheticEvent object
    console.log("Native Event:", event.nativeEvent); // Original browser event
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

### 📌 Output:

- `event` → React ka SyntheticEvent
- `event.nativeEvent` → actual browser event (MouseEvent, etc.)

---

## 🔍 **Why React Uses Synthetic Events?**

1. ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, IE… sab pe same behavior)
2. ✅ Performance (React pools events – explained below)
3. ✅ Custom behavior like `stopPropagation`, `preventDefault` with uniform API

---

## 🔧 **How It Works Internally:**

- React ek **event delegation system** use karta hai.
- Sare DOM events ek hi root element (like `#root`) pe register hote hain.
- Jab event trigger hota hai, React uska **SyntheticEvent object** banata hai.
- Ye object browser ke real event ka wrapper hota hai.
- After event handled → React us SyntheticEvent ko **reuse (pool)** kar leta hai (for optimization).

---

## ⚠️ Important Note: SyntheticEvent is "pooled"

React synthetic events are **pooled**, meaning:

> **After the event handler runs, the event object is reused.**

So agar aapko async mein use karna hai to event ko **persist** karna padta hai.

### ❌ Wrong:

```js
onClick={(e) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(e); // e will be nullified
  }, 1000);
}}
```

### ✅ Right:

```js
onClick={(e) => {
  e.persist(); // stop event pooling
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(e); // safe to use
  }, 1000);
}}
```

## 🧠 Interview Follow-Up Questions:

---

### 🔹 **Q1. What is the difference between Synthetic Event and Native Event?**

**Answer:**
Synthetic Event = React ka wrapper
Native Event = Browser ka original event
Synthetic me aapko consistent API milti hai, aur React performance ke liye pooling karta hai.

---

### 🔹 **Q2. Can we access native event inside synthetic event?**

**Answer:** ✅ Yes
Use `event.nativeEvent` to access it.

---

### 🔹 **Q3. What is event pooling in React?**

**Answer:**
React SyntheticEvents ko reuse karta hai (pooled), taaki performance better ho.
Ye event handler ke baad object ko nullify kar deta hai — so use `e.persist()` if needed.

---

### 🔹 **Q4. Do Synthetic Events bubble like native events?**

**Answer:** ✅ Yes
React Synthetic Events also **bubble** unless you call `e.stopPropagation()`.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature              | Synthetic Event        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| React Controlled?    | ✅ Yes                 |
| Cross-browser Safe?  | ✅ Yes                 |
| Access native event? | ✅ `event.nativeEvent` |
| Object reusable?     | ✅ (pooled)            |
| Stop pooling?        | ✅ `e.persist()`       |
