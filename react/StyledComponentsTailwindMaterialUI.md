### 🧵 **Styled Components**

- A **CSS-in-JS** library for styling React components.
- You write actual CSS inside JavaScript using template literals.
- Styles are scoped to components — no class name clashes.
- Supports themes and dynamic styling easily.

**Example:**

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px;
`;
```

### 💨 **Tailwind CSS**

- A **utility-first CSS framework** — you apply classes directly in JSX.
- No need to write separate CSS files.
- Super fast to build UIs once you know the classes.
- Highly customizable using config files.

**Example:**

```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2">Click</button>
```

### 🎨 **Material UI (MUI)**

- A **component library** based on Google’s Material Design.
- Comes with **ready-made components** (buttons, modals, tables, etc.)
- Highly customizable with themes and overrides.

**Example:**

```jsx
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";

<Button variant="contained" color="primary">
  Click
</Button>;
```
