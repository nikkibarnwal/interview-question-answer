## What are some common pitfalls of using useEffect, and how do you avoid them?

---

## ✅ **Answer :**

`useEffect` lets you run side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, timers, etc.
But using it wrongly can cause **bugs, performance issues**, or even **infinite loops**.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls of `useEffect` — and How to Avoid Them:

---

### 1️⃣ **Missing Dependencies (or extra dependencies)**

**Problem:** The effect depends on something, but it's not in the dependency array — or too many things are added.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(id); // 'id' is used but not added in deps
}, []); // ❌ Bug: if 'id' changes, effect won't re-run
```

✅ **Fix:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(id);
}, [id]);
```

🧠 **Tip:** Use ESLint plugin `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` to catch this.

---

### 2️⃣ **Infinite Loops**

**Problem:** Updating state inside `useEffect` **without proper condition** causes re-render → effect runs again → re-render → infinite loop.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1); // ❌ This will cause a loop
}, [count]);
```

✅ **Fix:** Avoid setting state based on the current state inside the effect, or use a condition.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (count < 5) setCount(count + 1);
}, [count]);
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Fetching data without cleanup**

**Problem:** If a component unmounts while the fetch is in progress, you may get a memory leak warning.

✅ **Fix:** Use a flag or `AbortController`.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });

  return () => controller.abort(); // ✅ Cleanup
}, []);
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Not using cleanup for subscriptions or timers**

**Problem:** `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, or event listeners stay active after the component is gone.

✅ **Fix: Always clean up in the return function**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => console.log("Tick"), 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval); // ✅ Cleanup
}, []);
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Side effects that should be inside an event, not useEffect**

**Problem:** Using `useEffect` for things like button clicks.

✅ **Fix:** Keep side effects inside events unless they're related to lifecycle.

```jsx
// ❌ Bad
useEffect(() => {
  if (clicked) doSomething();
}, [clicked]);

// ✅ Better
<button onClick={doSomething}>Click</button>;
```

## 🧠 Trick to Remember – "**DICE-C** Pitfalls"

- **D** – Dependencies missing or wrong
- **I** – Infinite loops from state updates
- **C** – Cleanup missing for fetch, timers, subscriptions
- **E** – Effects running on wrong triggers (should be in event)
- **C** – Cleanup always in return()

## ✅ Your Interview Summary:

> “I’m careful with `useEffect` dependencies and cleanup logic. I use the ESLint hook plugin to catch missing dependencies, and always clean up async effects, timers, or listeners. Also, I avoid using `useEffect` for things that can happen inside events.”
