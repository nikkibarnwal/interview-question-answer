Alright! Let‚Äôs break this down carefully. You asked: _‚Äúif I have a static method in a class then what will happen in JS‚Äù_. Let‚Äôs explain step by step.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Static Methods in JavaScript Classes

In JavaScript, a **static method** is a method that belongs to the **class itself**, not to instances of the class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  static greet() {
    console.log("Hello from static method!");
  }

  sayName() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How It Works

- **Static method call:** You call it directly on the class.

```js
Person.greet(); // ‚úÖ Hello from static method!
```

- **Instance cannot call it:** If you try to call it on an instance, it will fail.

```js
const user = new Person("Rajendra");
user.greet(); // ‚ùå TypeError: user.greet is not a function
```

- **Regular methods** (like `sayName`) are instance methods. They can only be called on an instance:

```js
user.sayName(); // ‚úÖ My name is Rajendra
Person.sayName(); // ‚ùå TypeError: Person.sayName is not a function
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Points

1. Static methods are **utility functions** related to the class but not tied to an instance.
2. They **cannot access instance properties** (`this.name`) because they don‚Äôt run on instances.
3. They **can access other static methods** or static properties of the same class using `this`.

```js
class Person {
  static greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }

  static greetLoudly() {
    this.greet(); // ‚úÖ Can call other static methods
    console.log("HELLO!!!");
  }
}

Person.greetLoudly();
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus: Static Properties

You can also have **static properties**, which work similarly:

```js
class Counter {
  static count = 0;

  static increment() {
    this.count++;
    console.log(this.count);
  }
}

Counter.increment(); // 1
Counter.increment(); // 2
```

üí° **Summary:**

- Static ‚Üí belongs to the class, not instances
- Instance ‚Üí belongs to objects created from class
- Static methods **cannot access instance properties**, but **can access static ones**

---

If you want, I can also show a **common interview trick question** where someone tries to use `this` in a static method to access instance data‚Äîit usually confuses a lot of people.

Do you want me to show that?
