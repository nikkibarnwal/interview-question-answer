Great ðŸš€ Letâ€™s create a **Q\&A set (7â€“10 questions)** on **Web Components vs React Components** that are **short, crisp, and interview-ready**.

# ðŸ”‘ Interview Q\&A: Web Components vs React Components

---

### **Q1. What are Web Components?**

**Ans:** Web Components are a set of browser standards (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Templates) that let you create **reusable custom HTML elements** without depending on any framework.

---

### **Q2. How are Web Components different from React Components?**

**Ans:**

- **Web Components** â†’ Framework-independent, native to browsers, reusable anywhere.
- **React Components** â†’ React-specific, rely on Virtual DOM, easier state management with hooks.

---

### **Q3. What are the main parts of Web Components?**

**Ans:**

1. **Custom Elements** â€“ Define new HTML tags.
2. **Shadow DOM** â€“ Provides encapsulation of DOM & CSS.
3. **HTML Templates** â€“ Reusable markup structures.

---

### **Q4. What are the benefits of Web Components?**

**Ans:**

- Work in **any framework** (React, Vue, Angular, plain HTML).
- Provide **style & DOM encapsulation**.
- **Future-proof** (based on browser standards).
- Great for **micro-frontends & design systems**.

---

### **Q5. When would you prefer Web Components over React?**

**Ans:**

- When building **cross-framework reusable UI libraries**.
- For **micro-frontends** with different frameworks.
- For **widgets** that need to be embedded anywhere (e.g., `<chat-widget>`).

---

### **Q6. When would you prefer React Components over Web Components?**

**Ans:**

- When building a **React application**.
- When you need **state management, hooks, and ecosystem libraries**.
- When team is already invested in **React ecosystem**.

---

### **Q7. How does encapsulation differ between Web Components and React?**

**Ans:**

- **Web Components** â†’ Shadow DOM (true encapsulation).
- **React** â†’ CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, but no real Shadow DOM.

---

### **Q8. How do Web Components handle state compared to React?**

**Ans:**

- **Web Components** â†’ Manual DOM & state updates.
- **React** â†’ Uses Virtual DOM + hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for automatic re-rendering.

---

### **Q9. Can you use Web Components inside React?**

**Ans:**
Yes âœ… You can use Web Components as custom elements inside React. But you may need **extra handling** for passing props and events (`onCustomEvent`).

---

### **Q10. Which one is better for performance: Web Components or React?**

**Ans:**

- **Web Components** â†’ Native DOM, no Virtual DOM overhead â†’ fast for isolated components.
- **React** â†’ Virtual DOM optimizes updates â†’ better for apps with complex, dynamic UIs.

---

ðŸ”¥ This set is exactly the kind of **short & sharp answers** interviewers expect.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also make a **visual diagram (flow/table style)** that shows **When to use Web Components vs React** so you can memorize faster before the interview?
