Great question 👌 Let’s break it down properly with **interview-style clarity** →

# 📝 Redis vs Memcached for Caching & Session Store

## 🔹 What is Caching?

- Store frequently used data in **memory** (instead of DB) → fast access.
- Example: user session, product list, leaderboard, API responses.

---

## 🔹 Redis

- **In-memory data store** (supports disk persistence).
- Stores data as: Strings, Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Bitmaps, HyperLogLogs.
- **Advanced features**: Pub/Sub, Streams, Transactions, Lua scripting.
- **Persistence**: Snapshotting (RDB) + Append Only File (AOF).
- **Clustering**: Supports replication + sharding.

👉 **Best for session store** because:

- Supports **TTL (expiry)** per key.
- Handles **complex data structures** (Hash = perfect for storing user session objects).
- Supports **replication & failover** → sessions survive crashes.

---

## 🔹 Memcached

- Simple **key-value store** (Strings only).
- Purely in-memory (❌ no persistence).
- Extremely fast (lighter than Redis).
- Scaling is **easy with consistent hashing**, but no built-in clustering.

👉 **Good for caching only** (API responses, HTML fragments),
❌ Not reliable for session storage (data lost on restart, no persistence).

## 🔹 Comparison Table

| Feature                   | Redis ✅                                | Memcached ❌          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Data Types                | Strings, Hash, List, Set, Sorted Set    | Strings only          |
| Persistence               | Yes (RDB, AOF)                          | No                    |
| Expiry per key            | Yes                                     | Yes                   |
| Session Store Suitability | Excellent (Hash + TTL)                  | Weak (no persistence) |
| Clustering/Scaling        | Yes (replication, sharding)             | Manual client-side    |
| Performance               | Slightly slower (but powerful)          | Ultra fast (simple)   |
| Use Case                  | Sessions, Queues, Leaderboards, Pub/Sub | Simple cache only     |

## 🔹 Benefits

- **Redis**

  - Reliable (data survives restart)
  - Rich data types → flexible sessions
  - HA + replication → good for distributed systems

- **Memcached**

  - Super lightweight & fast
  - Great for simple key-value cache
  - Easy to use & scale

---

## 🔹 Best Use Case

👉 **For session store → Redis is the clear winner** ✅
Because sessions need reliability + persistence + advanced data structures.
Memcached is better suited for **temporary caching only**.

---

⚡ Example: Express.js with Redis as session store

```js
const session = require("express-session");
const RedisStore = require("connect-redis").default;
const Redis = require("ioredis");

const redisClient = new Redis();

app.use(
  session({
    store: new RedisStore({ client: redisClient }),
    secret: "mySecretKey",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: { secure: false, maxAge: 60000 }, // 1 min
  })
);
```

---

👉 Interview Tip:
If asked _“Redis vs Memcached – which for session store?”_ → Answer:

✅ Redis → because it supports **persistence, replication, failover, rich data structures**, while Memcached loses data on restart and supports only simple key-value strings.
