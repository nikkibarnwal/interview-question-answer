Bilkul! Chaliye, **Node.js (Express) middleware** ko simple aur clear way me samjhte hain.

---

### **English Definition**

A **middleware** is a **function in Node.js (Express) that has access to the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects and can either terminate the request-response cycle or pass control to the next middleware in the stack**.
Basically, it's like a **pipeline** through which every HTTP request passes, and you can do some processing at each step.

**Syntax in Express:**

```js
function middlewareFunction(req, res, next) {
  // Do something with req or res
  next(); // Pass control to next middleware
}
```

---

### **Key Points**

1. Middleware **can modify `req` and `res` objects**.
2. Middleware can **end the request-response cycle** (for example, sending a response directly).
3. Middleware **can call `next()`** to pass control to the next middleware.
4. Middleware can be **global** (applied to all routes) or **route-specific**.

### **Example: Logging Middleware**

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Middleware function
function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // pass to next middleware or route
}

// Apply middleware globally
app.use(logger);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

✅ Output in console on visiting `/`:

```
GET /
```

### **Types of Middleware in Express**

1. **Application-level middleware** – applied to the whole app or specific routes.
2. **Router-level middleware** – applied to specific routers.
3. **Error-handling middleware** – handles errors (has 4 arguments: `err, req, res, next`).
4. **Built-in middleware** – like `express.json()` or `express.static()`.
5. **Third-party middleware** – like `cors`, `body-parser`, `helmet`.

Agar aap chaho, mai aapko **ek diagram ke saath middleware ka flow** bhi samjha doon, jisse interview me easily explain kar sako.

Kya mai wo bana doon?
