Perfect 👍 — since you’re preparing for **Senior Node.js Developer** interviews (especially for **MNC-level** companies), you can expect questions across **6 major areas**:
Architecture, Core Node.js, Asynchronous programming, Performance, Security, and System Design.

Let’s go topic-by-topic with **real MNC-level questions + sample answers** (in your style — practical + interview-friendly):

---

## 🧠 1. **Core Node.js Concepts**

### ❓Q1. What is the difference between process.nextTick(), setImmediate(), and setTimeout()?

👉 **Answer:**

- `process.nextTick()` → runs **before** the next event loop tick.
- `setImmediate()` → runs **after** I/O events in the **check phase**.
- `setTimeout(fn, 0)` → scheduled in the **timers phase**, so runs later than both.
  📌 In short:
  `nextTick()` → microtask queue (highest priority)
  `setImmediate()` → after I/O
  `setTimeout()` → after timers

---

### ❓Q2. How Node.js handles asynchronous operations internally?

👉 **Answer:**
Node uses **libuv** — it manages a **thread pool** and **event loop**.
When async tasks (like file read, DB query) occur → libuv delegates to worker threads → callback added back to event loop when done.
So Node.js is **single-threaded in JS layer**, but **multi-threaded under the hood**.

---

### ❓Q3. What are streams and why are they efficient?

👉 **Answer:**
Streams allow data to be **read/written in chunks**, not full load.
They use **backpressure** — readable stream pauses when writable is full.
Used for file handling, HTTP responses, etc.
📌 Example:

```js
fs.createReadStream("bigfile.txt").pipe(res);
```

This prevents memory overload.

## ⚙️ 2. **Architecture & Design**

### ❓Q4. How do you design scalable Node.js applications?

👉 **Answer (your style):**
Main focus — make it **stateless**, so it’s horizontally scalable.

- Move session to Redis.
- Use reverse proxy (NGINX / Load balancer).
- Break monolith into microservices.
- Use message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for async jobs.
- Use PM2 or Kubernetes for clustering & scaling.

---

### ❓Q5. How do you structure your Node.js project?

👉 **Answer:**
Follow modular structure:

```
src/
  controllers/
  models/
  routes/
  services/
  utils/
  middlewares/
  app.js
```

Each layer has single responsibility — Controller handles request/response, Service handles logic, Model interacts with DB.

---

## ⚡ 3. **Performance Optimization**

### ❓Q6. How do you identify and fix performance bottlenecks in Node.js?

👉 **Answer:**

- Use **clinic.js** or **Node --inspect** for profiling.
- Monitor **event loop lag** using `libuv` or tools like `clinic doctor`.
- Use caching (Redis / memory).
- Use async/await instead of blocking loops.
- Optimize DB queries.
- Use **worker_threads** for CPU-intensive tasks.

---

### ❓Q7. What are clusters in Node.js?

👉 **Answer:**
Cluster module lets you spawn multiple Node.js processes to utilize **multi-core CPUs**.
Example:

```js
import cluster from "cluster";
import os from "os";
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  os.cpus().forEach(() => cluster.fork());
} else {
  // Start server here
}
```

Each worker shares same port via load balancing.

---

## 🔒 4. **Security**

### ❓Q8. How do you secure a Node.js application?

👉 **Answer:**

- Validate inputs → prevent SQL/NoSQL injection.
- Use Helmet for HTTP headers.
- Sanitize data to avoid XSS.
- Use rate-limiting middleware.
- Hide error stack traces in prod.
- Keep dependencies updated & use npm audit.

---

## 🧩 5. **Database Integration**

### ❓Q9. How do you handle database connections efficiently?

👉 **Answer:**

- Use connection pooling (e.g. Mongoose connection pool).
- Reuse single DB connection instead of connecting per request.
- Close unused connections gracefully on shutdown.

---

### ❓Q10. How do you handle transactions in MongoDB or SQL from Node.js?

👉 **Answer:**

- In MongoDB, use `session.startTransaction()`.
- In SQL (Sequelize, Knex), use transaction blocks.
  This ensures atomicity — all or none.

---

## 🧱 6. **System Design & Microservices**

### ❓Q11. How do services communicate in a microservices architecture?

👉 **Answer:**

- Synchronous → REST or gRPC.
- Asynchronous → Message Queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS).
  I prefer message queues for **decoupling & reliability**.

---

### ❓Q12. How do you handle logging and monitoring?

👉 **Answer:**

- Use **Winston** or **Pino** for structured logs.
- Centralize logs to ELK or Datadog.
- Add request correlation IDs.
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics.

---

### ❓Q13. How do you handle configuration management in Node.js apps?

👉 **Answer:**
Use environment-based config:

```
config/
  development.json
  production.json
```

Load using dotenv or config library. Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables or Vault.

---

## 🧮 7. **Advanced / Coding Round Examples**

### ❓Q14. Implement a simple rate limiter middleware

👉 **Answer:**

```js
const rateLimit = {};
export const limiter = (req, res, next) => {
  const ip = req.ip;
  const now = Date.now();
  rateLimit[ip] = rateLimit[ip]?.filter((t) => now - t < 60000) || [];
  if (rateLimit[ip].length >= 10)
    return res.status(429).send("Too many requests");
  rateLimit[ip].push(now);
  next();
};
```

Allows only 10 requests/min per IP.

---

### ❓Q15. What is event-driven architecture in Node.js?

👉 **Answer:**
Node.js core is **event-driven** — uses **EventEmitter** pattern.
Example:

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.on("orderCreated", () => console.log("Order processed"));
emitter.emit("orderCreated");
```

Used in microservices & async flows.
