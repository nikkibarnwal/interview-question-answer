<!-- How do you handle production issues via post-mortems to identify root cause -->

Here‚Äôs how you can answer **‚ÄúHow do you handle production issues via post-mortems to identify root cause?‚Äù** ‚Äî especially for a **Lead MERN Stack Developer / Tech Lead** position:

---

### ‚úÖ **Sample Answer (Structured, Confident & Technical):**

> **1. Immediate Containment:**
> First, we focus on **stabilizing the system** ‚Äî rollback, scaling up, or applying a temporary patch if required. Our goal is to **minimize user impact** before deep-diving into the cause.

> **2. Data Collection:**
> Once the issue is contained, I collect **logs, monitoring metrics, and traces** from tools like **Elastic Stack, CloudWatch, or Datadog** to understand what exactly happened ‚Äî API latency, DB spikes, memory leaks, etc.

> **3. Post-Mortem Meeting:**
> We conduct a **blameless post-mortem** within 24‚Äì48 hours involving developers, QA, DevOps, and sometimes product managers.
> The discussion covers:
>
> - **Timeline** of events (when it started, detected, fixed)
> - **Impact** (which users/features were affected)
> - **Root cause analysis (RCA)** using methods like **5 Whys** or **Fishbone Diagram**
> - **Missed detection points** (Why monitoring or tests didn‚Äôt catch it?)

> **4. Root Cause Identification:**
> Example: If a MongoDB query caused latency, we identify whether it was due to **missing indexes**, **large payloads**, or **unoptimized aggregation**.
> We also check **code review gaps, lack of test coverage**, or **missing alerts** that could have prevented it.

> **5. Permanent Fix and Action Items:**
>
> - Implement code fixes and add **automated regression tests**.
> - Add **monitoring alerts** and **dashboards** if missing.
> - Update **runbooks** or **deployment checklists** to avoid recurrence.
> - Document everything clearly in a **Post-Mortem Report (Confluence / Notion)**.

> **6. Continuous Improvement:**
> We track all action items in Jira and review them in our **retrospective** to ensure lessons learned are implemented.
> I also make sure **knowledge is shared** across the team so others don‚Äôt repeat similar mistakes.

### üß† Example Summary (If interviewer wants short version):

> I handle production issues by first containing the problem, then leading a blameless post-mortem to gather data, analyze root cause using methods like ‚Äú5 Whys,‚Äù document findings, and define long-term preventive actions ‚Äî like better monitoring, tests, and deployment safeguards.
