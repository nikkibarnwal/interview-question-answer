Describe yourself

---

\*\*“Hi, I’m Rajendra Modi. I’m a Senior Full Stack Developer with around 10+ years of experience in web development, and for the last 5 years, I’ve been mainly working on React and the MERN stack. I’m skilled in React, Redux, Context API, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JavaScript — along with API integrations, testing, and performance optimization.

Currently, I’m working on a membership-based web application similar to Amazon Prime, where users can purchase Club or Business memberships and earn rewards like cashback or vouchers. The system also manages supplemental members, renewals, and upgrades. My main focus is building scalable React components, developing REST APIs with Node.js and Express, and optimizing performance using MongoDB.

I regularly use Git for version control and Jira for sprint planning, task tracking, and collaboration with cross-functional teams. I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing system performance, and writing clean, maintainable code that delivers real business value.”\*\*
